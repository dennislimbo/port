Highlights of their collection include furniture, architecture, and graphic arts.

            <h2>Learning from Wim Crouwel</h2>
            <p>Through a deep study of Wim Crouwel and his works, we identified three qualities that set the precedent for art direction:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Abstract typography to increase readability</li>
                <li>Large and simple negative space created through alignment</li>
                <li>2D and 3D geometric art crafted based off a grid</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Graphical Assets</h2>
            <p>Using these four qualities, we created a poster and banner meant to be seen on the streets that would entice people to visit the museum. Business cards were also created for the Bauhaus Archiv employees to give out to their clients.</p>

            <h2>From Assets to Microsite</h2>
            <p><span class="highlight">The intent behind the microsite was to intervene at the pre-purchase stage and help people look through and discover items in the collection.</span> The content of the microsite was organized into collections of items created by the different individuals of the Bauhaus. This allows them to go from the overall collection to a more specific collection based on who they are interested in.</p>

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>This project taught me how core graphic design principles can be applied to creating digital user interfaces. On a more personal note, through studying Crouwel and trying to understand his decision making and graphic design tendencies, <span class="highlight"> I learned more about how I like to approach design.</span> From Crouwel, Iâ€™ve adopted a systematic approach to my design work.</p>
