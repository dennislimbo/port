        <h3>Business Opportunity</h3>
        <p>NY Times has been heavily focused on digital subscription growth. In recent years, they have been successful and remain focused on maintaining it. However, this growth was largely driven by offering a promotional rate and when it came time to renew, many readers would unsubscribe. </p>
        <img src="assets/nyt/images/subscription.png" alt="A few charts and graphs about NYT subscription growth and cancellations. From 2018 to 2022, subscriber count has seen steady growth. Change in subscription has a negative trend from 2022 onward. According to Nieman Lab, it is the most cancelled news subscription">
        <h3>Research Insights</h3>
        <p>Through our research we identified the primary reason for cancellation was because readers did not feel they had enough time to read the news. They would spend time in the morning to plan out their day and if reading the NY Times was not included, then they would not engage with it.</p>

        <h3>Framing</h3>
        <p>We saw an opportunity to retain subscribers by providing a means to consume NY Times content in methods that fit their busy schedules. With our research and insights in mind we asked ourselves,</p>
        <blockquote>
            <h2>How might we help an occasional reader form a routine to integrate daily news consumption into their day to day lives?</h2>
        </blockquote>
        <h3>Proposed Solution</h3>
        <p>In order to retain existing subscriber who do not make the time to read, we propose audio-based article playlists to help occasional readers consume news content at times that fit within their busy schedules.</p>

            <h3>Reflection</h3>
            <p>The challenge with this project was identifying a problem space where design could intervene. Once the business opportunity was identified, through user research we were able to identify what aspects were desirable and which parts needed refinement.</p>
            <p>Through this project I learned how we can identify a concept in one domain and translate that into another context to provide simple, but effective solution. One consideration for the future would be how the audio aspect can be implemented from the development side of the business.</p>
