            <h1>Dutch Design Week</h1>
            <p>
                Dutch Design Week (DDW) is an annual design event that takes place in Eindhoven, Netherlands. The festival focuses on showcasing design for possible futures. It is also an opportunity for people in the design industry to meet new talent and engage with their projects and ideas.

            <h3>Role</h3>
            <p>UX Research, UI Design, Interaction Design</p>
            <h3>Tools</h3>
            <p>Adobe XD, Photoshop, InDesign, Surveys, User Interviews, Affinity Diagramming</p>
            <h3>Team</h3>
            <p>Virginia Chu, Nicole Tam, Emma Tynan</p>

        <div class="content">
            <h2>Primary Research — Surveys and User Interviews</h2>
            <p>Our initial research question was to understand <span class="highlight">how past attendees experienced DDW in the past as well as their goals for attending the event. </span> Most of these questions were qualitative in nature as there were many different events and exhibits at the festival so we wanted to capture the different experiences that people had during their time there. We were also able to connect with five previous presenters at the event for an interview about their experiences.</p>
            <h2>From Research to Insights and Personas</h2>
            <p>After conducting our primary research and secondary research, affinity diagramming was done to organize the observations and qualitative data. Through these groupings, we created two personas and identified four key insights:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Visitors at Dutch Design Week are fascinated by projects that help reveal future possibilities</li>
                <li>Exhibitors want to share their work where they can get direct feedback and reactions from visitors</li>
                <li>Creative process is not limited to the design profession. In fact, it is an expected skill in many tech companies in Eindhoven</li>
                <li>By engaging with exhibitors’ work at Dutch Design Week, visitors discover new perspectives that challenge their existing knowledge</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Design Focus</h2>
            <span class="highlight"><h3>Problem Statement</h3></span>
            <p>Professionals can learn about approaching work challenges differently through understanding exhibitors’ creative process and how they can use it at Dutch Design Week.</p>
            <span class="highlight"><h3>Final Framing</h3></span>
            <p>How might we help professionals learn from an exhibitor’s creative process in order to bring a new perspective to their work?</p>
            <h2>Solution Proposal</h2>
            <p>An application that puts users in the designer’s shoes. The app is for professionals that want to learn more about the exhibits at Dutch Design Week. <span class="highlight">The goal is to give them technical information about an exhibit whilst showing them the thought process behind the decisions made by the creator.</span></p>
            <h2>Application Flow</h2>
            <p>We ideated three key wireflows that were designed to help DDW visitors discover future possibilities, encourage their creativity, and gain new perspectives about topics they are familiar with. These flows were then turned into clickable prototypes.</p>

                <p>The first time the user opens the app, after the splash screen, they enter their profession and interests. This initial step will help to suggest exhibits and events for them that they may be interested which helps them find things to do at the event.</p>

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>
                This was the first time I had gone through the process of <span class="highlight">conducting formative UX 
                research and then using that research to ideate and create a prototype for a solution.</span> 
                On top of technical skills like research planning, analysis methods, wireframing, and 
                prototyping, I also learned that I enjoy talking to people and conducting user 
                interviews. <span class="highlight">Learning about why people do the things they do and designing an experience 
                for them around those learnings is something that I want to do my future work.</span>
