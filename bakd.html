            <h1>BAK'D</h1>
            <p>BAK’D is an online cookie business operating in Metro Vancouver. It was started by a brother-sister duo who are known for their hospitality and are well-loved by their community. Currently, they operate through online orders and farmer’s market events.</p>

            <h2>Initial Research Findings</h2>
            <p>Initial primary and secondary research consisted of interviews with the owners, staff, and customers at farmer’s market events. Three key insights emerged:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><span class="highlight">Their story is key</span> — People are drawn to BAK’D because of their sibling co-founder story, and they want to support a local business</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">BAK’D is in a transition period</span> — Business is booming and so naturally, a physical location is the next step for the business. This new domain brings with it, new customer</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">DIY Branding</span> — BAK’D takes on a do-it-yourself approach to all if their physical and web assets which affects brand trust and legitimacy.</li>
            </ol>
            <h2>Point of Intervention</h2>
            <p>To better understand our client and audience, we created journey maps to identify potential points of intervention using our initial research. The scenario we chose to use was a customer placing a bulk order as we were toying with the idea of intervening there.</p>

            <h2>Input From Potential Customers</h2>
            <p>We wondered what a potential customer’s first impressions of the website would be, so we conducted a series of think aloud tests with participants. We recruited individuals that fit BAK’D’s target demographic but had not heard about them before. Participants were asked to spend 10 minutes freely browsing the site before we asked them about the experience. We learned that:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><span class="highlight">Content doesn’t reflect who BAK’D is.</span> The information present doesn’t give a clear indication of who the people behind BAK’D are and what they offer which leaves a poor impression of their true ethos</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">The number of pages in the navigation bar is overwhelming</span> and it is hard to know where to find certain information on the site.</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">The homepage is a business sandwich.</span> There is an emphasis on having reviews from customers and media outlets to create trust and try to make BAK’D appear more legitimate.</li>
            </ol>
            <h2>Design Focus</h2>
            <p>How might we convey BAK’D’s quality and ethos to first time customers so that they know they are buying more than just a cookie</p>
            <h2>Concept</h2>
            <p>In order to communicate who BAK’D is and what they offer to new customers, we proposed a website re-design as it is a high traffic touchpoint. It will provide people a simplified ordering experience that provides clear details on each cookie.</p>
            <span class="highlight"><h3>Addressing the Homepage</h3></span>
            <p>The new iteration of the homepage (and the website in general) uses simplified navigation which removes redundant content and pages. At the same time, the content on the homepage focuses on Jess and Andy, as well as the cookies. Without all the clutter.</p>

            <span class="highlight"><h3>Simplified Ordering</h3></span>
            <p>Shop offerings are combined in a central space to minimize pages and present a streamlined ordering process that visualizes the cookies.</p>

            <span class="highlight"><h3>Celebrating Jess and Andy</h3></span>
            <p>The about page of the site showcases the journey of Jess and Andy. It is broken down into segments supported with imagery so visitors can better understand the people behind BAK’D.</p>

            <span class="highlight"><h3>Bulk Request System</h3></span>
            <p>A system was created that would handle a bulk request which provides a way for customers to effectively communicate their needs to BAK’D. At the same time, Jess and Andy receive the exact information they need pertaining to each order.</p>

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>Speaking with real customers and people that fit the target audience helped guide us to a design solution. The initial field studies aided greatly in identifying how we might help our client continue to grow their business. Once we were deep in the process, the input we received through <span class="highlight">observations of how people used the website identified which aspects of the business and website to focus on.</span></p>
